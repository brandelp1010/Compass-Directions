🧭 Compass Directions – RuneLite Plugin

A RuneLite plugin that enhances the in-game minimap compass by adding customizable N, S, E, W cardinal direction labels directly around the compass.

This plugin is designed to be lightweight, clean, and fully configurable so players can align the compass exactly how they want.

✨ Features

Displays N, E, S, W around the minimap compass

Fully configurable positioning and styling

Per-direction fine-tuning for rotation

Optional hiding of the North label (to keep the default compass “N”)

Adjustable font size and color

Clean UI with grouped settings

Zero gameplay impact – purely visual

⚙️ Configuration

The plugin provides three organized configuration sections:

🔧 General

Show North – Toggle the “N” label on/off

Text Color – Choose the color of the direction letters

Font Size – Adjust the size of the letters

📐 Offsets

Fine-tune positioning using neutral-centered sliders:

Center X Shift – Horizontal alignment

Center Y Shift – Vertical alignment

Radius Shift – How far letters sit from the compass

These sliders are centered around a neutral midpoint so you don’t need negative numbers.

🔄 Rotation

Adjust each label independently in degrees:

North Offset

East Offset

South Offset

West Offset

Useful for compensating for UI scaling, DPI differences, or personal preference.

🎯 Purpose

This plugin exists to solve a small but real usability issue:
RuneLite’s compass only shows North, which can be disorienting when navigating or rotating the minimap.

Compass Directions adds clear orientation without cluttering the UI.
